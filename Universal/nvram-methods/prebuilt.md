# Fixing NVRAM: Prebuilt

By far the easiest method, all you need to do is download the following file:

* [SSDT-PMC.aml](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/blob/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-PMC.aml)

Main things to note with this method:

* Bit Bloated
  * There's ACPI naming for most common paths, this means there's added delays in boot times(though unnoticeable to most as it's generally less than 0.5 seconds longer)
* Doesn't really teach you anything
  * For most, this doesn't matter. But to some knowing what makes your hackintosh tick is part of the journey
  
## Wrapping up

Once you're done making your SSDT, either head to the next page to finish the rest of the SSDTs or head here if you're ready to warp up:

* [**Cleanup**](/cleanup.md)
