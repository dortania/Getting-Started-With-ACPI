# Fixing Property Injection: SSDTTime

This method involves using SSDTTime which automates most of the process. See here on how to use it: [SSDTs: Easy Way](/ssdt-methods/ssdt-easy.md)

To get SSDT-BRG0, run the following:

* `7. Dump DSDT` then run `9. PCI Bridge`

This will provide you with some files, the main one you care about is SSDT-BRG0.**aml**. The DSDT and .dsl are only left for referencing or verification.


## Wrapping up

Once you're done making your SSDT, either head to the next page to finish the rest of the SSDTs or head here if you're ready to wrap up:
