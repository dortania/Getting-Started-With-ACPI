# Fixing RHUB: SSDTTime

The second involves using SSDTTime which automates most of the process. See here on how to use it: [SSDTs: Easy Way](/ssdt-methods/ssdt-easy.md)

To get the SSDT-RHUB, run the following:

* `8. Dump DSDT` then run `7. USB Reset`

This will provide you with some files, the main one you care about is SSDT-USB-Reset.**aml**(Same file as SSDT-RHUB). The DSDT and .dsl are only left for referencing or verification.

The main things to note with this method:

* Doesn't really teach you anything
  * For most, this doesn't matter. But to some knowing what makes your hackintosh tick is part of the journey
