# Fixing Trackpads (SSDT-GPI0/XOSI)

The second involves using SSDTTime which automates most of the process. See here on how to use it: [SSDTs: Easy Way](/ssdt-methods/ssdt-easy.md)

To get the SSDT-EC on desktops, run the following:

* `P. Dump DSDT` then run `A. XOSI`,then, select the version of Windows you have installed now.

This will provide you with some files, the main one you care about is SSDT-GPI0.**aml**. or SSDT-XOSI.**aml**. The DSDT and .dsl are only left for referencing or verification.

The main things to note with this method:

* Doesn't really teach you anything
  * For most, this doesn't matter. But to some knowing what makes your hackintosh tick is part of the journey
* Can only make SSDT-XOSI
  * If you need SSDT-GPI0, then you still need to make it manually

## Wrapping up

Once you're done making your SSDT, either head to the next page to finish the rest of the SSDTs or head here if you're ready to wrap up:
