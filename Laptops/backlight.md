## What this SSDT does

The purpose of this SSDT is to create a PNLF device for macOS to play with, specifically one with a hardware ID of `APP0002`. Luckily WhateverGreen will handle the rest of the work for us.

For the backlight fix, there are several methods you can choose from:

* [Prebuilt](/Laptops/backlight-methods/prebuilt.md)
