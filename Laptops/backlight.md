## What this SSDT does

The purpose of this SSDT is to create a PNLF device for macOS to play with, specifically one with a hardware ID of `APP0002`. Luckily WhateverGreen will handle the rest of the work for us.

## Methods to make this SSDT

For the backlight fix, there are 3 methods you can choose from:

* [Prebuilt](/Laptops/backlight-methods/prebuilt.md)
* [SSDTTime](/Laptops/backlight-methods/SSDTTime.md)
