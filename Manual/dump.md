# Getting a copy of your DSDT

So to start, we'll need to get a copy of your DSDT from your firmware. The easiest way is grabbing the DSDT.aml SSDTTime dumped for us earlier but here are some other options:

## From Windows

* [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)
  * Supports both Windows and Linux for DSDT dumping
  * `8. Dump DSDT - Automatically dump the system DSDT`
* [acpidump.exe](https://acpica.org/downloads/binary-tools)
  * In command prompt run `path/to/acpidump.exe -b -n DSDT -z`, this will dump your DSDT as a .dat file. Rename this to DSDT.aml
  
* Do note that all ACPI patches from clover/OpenCore will be applied to the DSDT with the above 2 methods
  
## From Linux

* [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime)
  * Supports both Windows and Linux for DSDT dumping
  * `4. Dump DSDT - Automatically dump the system DSDT`
* sysfs
  * Run `sudo cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT > DSDT.aml`

* Do note that all ACPI patches from clover/OpenCore will be applied to the DSDT with the above 2 methods

## From Clover

For those with Clover installed previously, this is a simple way to get your ACPI tables:

* F4 in Clover Boot menu
  * DSDT can be found in `EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin`, the folder **must** exist before dumping

## From OpenCore

With OpenCore, we have 2 options:

* [SysReport Quirk](#sysreport-quirk)
* [UEFI Shell](#uefi-shell)

### SysReport Quirk

With OpenCore 0.5.9, we have a new quirk called SysReport which will actually dump your DSDT automatically when hitting the boot screen. The main issues are:

* You already need a bootable OpenCore USB to get this dump
* This also requires a DEBUG version of 0.5.9

For the latter, you just need to replace the following files with [DEBUG version](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases):

* EFI/BOOT/
  * `BOOTx64.efi`
* EFI/OC/Bootstrap/
  * `Bootstrap.efi`
* EFI/OC/Drivers/
  * `OpenRuntime.efi`
* EFI/OC/
  * `OpenCore.efi`

For the former, you can actually skip the ACPI section, return to the [OpenCore guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and finish making the USB. Once booted to the picker, you can shut off the PC and check your USB:

And voila! You have a DSDT! Now you can continue on with making SSDTs

### UEFI Shell

For this, we'll want to grab [`acpidump.efi`](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Install-Guide/tree/master/extra-files/acpidump.efi.zip) and add this to `EFI/OC/Tools` and in your config under `Misc -> Tools` with the argument: `-b -n DSDT -z` and select this option in OpenCore's picker.

If OpenCore is having issues running acpidump.efi from the boot picker, you can call it from the shell with [OpenShell](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)(reminder to add to both `EFI/OC/Tools` and in your config under `Misc -> Tools` ):

```
shell> fs0: // replace with proper drive
fs0:\> dir  // to verify this is the right directory
   Directory of fs0:\
   01/01/01 3:30p EFI
fs0:\> cd EFI\OC\Tools
fs0:\EFI\OC\Tools> acpidump.efi -b -n DSDT -z  
 ```

 Once done, you should find your DSDT in the EFI/OC/Tools folder with a `.dat` extension. Rename this DSDT.dat file to DSDT.aml to help us down the line
